# ROBOCROP
### What is RoboCrop?  
  Robocrop is a perfect marriage of IoT and Artificial Intelligence to bring out a solution in the trillion dollar agricultural market. Robocrop enables a plant to move and interact with other IoT devices around it. For Example, If the plants needs water it can move to the location of the tap. It can then turn on the water by directly communicating to the tap therefore realizing pure M2M communication. The soil moisture sensors onboard help the plant to decide when it needs water. Other sensors include luminosity, environment temperature and humidity.   
  The sentimental analysis model exploits this sensor data to estimate the plant's sentiment and put them out in words (a.k.a slack messages/ text messages). Also, knwing the current state of the plant we can simulate reactions to human stimuli. This is done using Microsoft's Text Analytics API which returns the sentiment score of the human stimuli(text message). Microsoft's azure services were used to design the whole system some of which include IoT hub,Stream Analytics, Blob storages, ML studio etc.
  
### Why does a plant need sentiments or portability?  
  As humans we have forgotten to take care of the environment around us and RoboCrop was an attempt to pump love for trees and plants among people. Robocrop makes plants your pets, pets you can talk to. 

### Why Microsoft Azure?  
 Given the complexity of the entire mechanism and time ocnstraints, deloying a server and loading different modules to interface Iot and A.I. would have been a arduous task. On the other hand, deploying a serverless system was easier and much more intuitive to work on. Why Microsoft though? Power BI marked the pivot point of the decision. While other services provide ML solutions analogous to Azure, A powerful and easy to use UI interface was required to provide real time analytics to users.
 
### What other things is RoboCrop capaable of?  
 RoboCrop can take care of itself. It can calculate exact amounts of resources needed and when they are needed. This helps in maximizing the yield. As a technology, RoboCrop generates a 1200 data points per hour which equates to more than 10 million datapoints a year from one plant. The data collected is huge and can be used for further improvements in the agricultural industry.
DATA IS THE NEW CURRENCY!
